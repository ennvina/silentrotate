<h1>SilentRotate</h1>
<p>This addon helps setting up rotations for specific classes or specific roles in raid.</p>

<p>While it is more efficient if all involved players can view the list by themselves, ultimately not all raid members need to install the addon, considering a raid leader/assistant is willing to tell the rotation e.g. with voice comm.</p>
<p>This addon is heavily based on the work of Slivo for the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tranqrotate">TranqRotate addon</a>, which you might want to install if you are interested only in Hunter&rsquo;s Tranquilizing Shot rotation.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before the fight begins, choose the correct mode you want to setup (Loatheb, Misdirection, Grounding Totem, etc.).</li>
<li>The SilentRotate window displays the list of raid members who may be part of the rotation. Only relevant members are displayed for a given rotation, e.g. only hunters are displayed in Misdirection mode.</li>
<li>Players in the list can be drag'n'dropped to change their order. Members pushed to the very bottom are <i>backup</i> players who do not enter the normal rotation.</li>
<li>Right-clicking on a player in the list opens a context menu to assign a target. This functionality is enabled only in modes where pre-assignment makes sense, such as Misdirection or Fear Ward.</li>
<li>The list may be setup by another class. For example, a warrior raid leader may select the "Loatheb" mode and change the order of players, even though the warrior will not be in the list.</li>
<li>The list is shared across all raid members who have installed the addon. Each player can choose its own mode, in which case the list is shared between players who have selected the same mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<ul>
<li>The next player in the rotation is highlighted in the list.</li>
<li>Once a player has cast a spell that triggers the rotation, a cooldown bar is shown in this player&rsquo;s bar and the next player in the rotation is highlighted.</li>
<li>Disconnected players and dead players do not take part in the rotation anymore and appear as gray or red, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul>
<li>A History window keeps track of events that are relevant to a given mode.</li>
<li>For example, in Grounding Totem mode, the History window displays when a totem is summoned, when it absorbs a spell, or when it has been replaced by another Wind totem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modes</h2>
<p>There are up to 14 modes: Tranq, Loatheb, Distract, FearWard, AoE Taunt, Misdirection, Bloodlust, Grounding Totem, Battle Rez, Innervate, BoP, Freedom, Soulstone and Soulwell.</p>
<p>The mode is selected automatically upon login and can be changed by clicking on top of the SilentRotate window.</p>
<p>Not all modes are visible because the number of buttons would make the UI too messy.</p>
<p>These modes are visible by default in Classic Era:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tranq</li>
<li>Loatheb</li>
<li>Fear Ward</li>
</ul>
<p>These modes are visible by default in Burning Crusade Classic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misdirection</li>
<li>Bloodlust</li>
<li>Fear Ward</li>
</ul>
<p>You can select which modes are visible in the Settings panel.</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only one mode can be active at a time</li>

<li>Loatheb mode does not filter out non-healer specs, such as Feral Druids</li>

<li>Talents which have an impact on spells, such as Guardian's Favor in the Paladin tree, are not tracked</li>
<li>Group-based modes, such as Bloodlust, only track the buff from its initial caster, not every target in the group</li>
<li>Tranq mode does not filter out hunters who have not learned the Tranquilizing Shot ability yet, e.g. l&oslash;&oslash;ted the Tome of Tranquilizing Shot from Lucifron</li>
<li>More generally, the addon does not check, and sometimes cannot check, if players have learned their abilities from their respective class trainers</li>
<li>Any raid member can change the order of players in the list</li>
<li>Raid members who have not installed the addon must be in the range of 45-ish yards to detect their activity</li>
<li>Localization is incomplete (see below)</li>
